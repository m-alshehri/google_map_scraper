عبدالله ABDULLAH,4 stars,"A massive airport, built to handle millions of passengers. The busiest airport in the kingdom. Nice architecture. Clean . Well managed and maintained. Efficient security and immigration. There are three major areas. Domestic, international and Haj. In Domestic and international,   so many services and facilities, restaurants and Cafe's, children play areas, gift and souvenir shops, ATM'S, luxury brands, hotel, lounges, and much more. Comfortable and clean seating in waiting areas.",302 reviews,3 months ago,6
Zeeshan Arshad,4 stars,"This is one of the most busy airport in kingdom. Infrastructure is appealing, A big fish aquarium is one of the attractions here An improved version of this airport is good now. Many duty free shops, food points, coffee shops, banks and much more. Service is improved, staff is hard work,  immigration counter is active. Domestic operation is more good than international Maybe in future, it will get more flights. Please like this review if it's helpful for you.",302 reviews,6 months ago,17
Noorzidah M N,3 stars,"Spacious, big and clean airport. We checked in as early as 3hrs in advance. The female staff seems to be slow in doing their work. They pick and choose who they want to serve. Only 2 counters are open and they are served by male staff. If the other 2 females are willing to open their counters, then you get to be served by them. We have to take train to another terminal before departure. The train has 2 carriages but they only open 1 only so it's really very crammed.",315 reviews,3 months ago,6
Shahidul Islam,5 stars,"One of the most beautiful airport even seen before. Very big arrangement for our services. Interior decoration and themes is amazing at all.

Thanks to Saudi Arabia for giving us such beautiful and easier life.",4 reviews,4 months ago,1
Xuzar,3 stars,"i have seen number of 5 stars for this airport, but not able to understand why all these 5 stars may be just by looks, yes no doubt airport looks very beautiful neat and clean, immigration process is also smooth, at security checks after check in most of people were no bothering about queues or anybody standing before them but again these are people may be its not airports fault this is not the reason i am giving less stars, my reasons are as follows apart from gates of restaurants there is not seating area available to relax or wait it was morning time before my flight i went to toilet and 1st thing found there was no toilet rolls and in that toilet area there was almost 6 sinks and tabs but only one was working strangely it was long queue for hand wash, i think management over there need to look into these small things although it is one of the best airport but these small things make huge difference for visitors",106 reviews,10 months ago,27
Tanvir Prince,5 stars,"I saw some bad reviews. But for me and my family everything went well. So I must give it a 5 star. The check in is very smooth. You can get one Zamzam water per passport. This may depend on the season and airlines. So please check with your airlines. We were four passengers and got four Zamzam water, 5L each, I believe.  I wish staff could speak English well. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what they are saying. There are plenty of shops and bathrooms all around.",81 reviews,5 months ago,5
Mohamed Alkharashy,1 star,"The new terminal is way better than the old terminals, however still way far from other important airports in the region. Average restaurants and small duty free shops are available The most important advice to all travellers : Be careful, Never, ever, put any valuable items in your check-in luggage, most likely, they will be robbed out of your bags.",267 reviews,4 months ago,12
Yousef Ahmed,5 stars,"One of the best airports I have been to since my young journey, maybe there's much amazing one, but as far, this airport wins. The architecture is perfect, attractive and modern. Transportation facilities are superiorly satisfactory, there are buses that takes passengers from down town to the terminal frequently. As well as, the train inside the building, which helps you to reach the gate faster.",26 reviews,8 months ago,4
Abdullah Abukashef,4 stars,"As it becomes confusing with direction and the naming of the airport! If you wish to get to the local flight! Then you need to google the following "" Jeddah new airport"". The airport has been renovated and still attracting many businesses. Really nice to navigate around but you need to get there at least an hour earlier. Almost everything you need/wish to buy is there tax-free.",20 reviews,6 months ago,2
Ele B,5 stars,"The airport is looking very modern and there are female workers too. I've been here 5 years ago and I can say confidently that so many things have changed.

Multiple runways and hundreds of aircrafts can be parked at a time.  But extremely mismanaged airport with poorly trained staff.

You can find ZamZam water on Intl Departure terminal B2.",343 reviews,5 months ago,5
AbdulAziz Abdullah N,4 stars,"New airport that running gradually and has large facilities. The area around airport still not running fully, there is barriers and Road diversions upon entire airport area. Still no first class lounge area from internal flight rather than the national airline, Saudia, other passengers who enjoy traveling with other airlines they will not find first class lounge. There are many restaurants and still they are going to open more. Comparing with old airport, this is definitely better.",65 reviews,a year ago,7

Rizky J. Putri,4 stars,"The airport was so huge! The facility was good but no electricity port for charging your phone. It was only in gate 12. This airport has prayers room, but you meed to take your own hijabi. The gate quite far from oje to each other. Inguess they has more than 50 gates in whole. For you who have hajj/umrah visas, you can bring zamzam water 5liter max each person. You can buy it in Kiosk Zamzam beetween B2 C1 gate door for 8,5 SAR. It’s free baggage for all aircraft, perhaps.",130 reviews,a month ago,
Abdullah Shahid,3 stars,"They have opened the airport, build a nice and beautiful airport but it remains one of the worst in terms of service. No online check-ins accepted. You have to queue up for the boarding pass. Don't know in which age they are living. Can't handle the customers. Bad attitude, slow service. They can't handle airbus 380 passengers who were all queued up for more than 1 hour. And believe me, there is no internet at the airport. Zamzam is available at the counter near terminal C. Another good thing is that Harmain train terminal connects you to Makkah madina and Jeddah.",191 reviews,5 months ago,2

MUHAMMAD MANSOOR ISMAIL (Mansoor),3 stars,It's newly built airport terminal. I was transiting from this airport to and from Pakistan. It is an state of the art construction with multiple terminals and many gates. Baggage service is good but it needs to manually transfer by the passengers to nearby Baggage drop area. Also some of the services like bus transfer from terminal to aircraft is a tedious process specially when you are travelling with family 👪.,415 reviews,a year ago,8

Ammar Hasanie,3 stars,Flew from this airport few days back and checked in early thinking shall buy some zam zam water and eat there. They did not allow us to buy water from airport as the embassy put tourist visa instead of umrah dispute us applying for umrah. The airport is new but feels empty and nothing much to do. Limited eating places also. Staff are friendly but God help you if you have a lay over longer the two hours. The airport is small and boring and I guess opened to early as construction work is still ongoing. I guess if going for Umrah one has no choice. They should allow passengers that have preformed umrah to take some water back. We should be allowed 5l per passenger and we were six but did not even allow one. Best is buy outside and pack in your own bags and don’t risk buying from the airport as they sell depending on there mood. The officials just make stuff up as they seem fit as I have experienced on my visit. SAudi has a long way to go yet to make international travellers feel safe and at home. Another main POINT NO WORKING WIFI🤨. The kids went ballistic as it was just impossible to connect to there so called free WiFi unless you have a local number or are on roaming! Why make it so hard? 4 hours at the airport with young children and no WiFi just imagine 🙈,128 reviews,2 months ago,1

Faster passport control, professional check-in staff, excellent wide spaces…the one thing to remind ourself is that In the older airport the walk past passport control could’ve barely been 10 mins whereas the walk right now can easily reach 25 mins so be aware of this!

But one thing, both the new and old airports are with the same name but they are very far apart, so when going to airport with taxi or uber has to be very specify about the terminal, the new airport is terminal one. Especially in uber if just click on King Abdulaziz airport it send you to the old airport, it just happened to me and costs me 150 for taxi to come to the new airport",53 reviews,2 months ago,
Captain T,1 star,"The control tower has a nice design, but that's all there's to it...  Rude and incompetent staff.  The incompetent niqab-veiled woman at security didn't dare to touch a man to check his pockets. Had to put my cash money in an empty tray with nothing to put on top of it... The x-ray machine's curtains then proceeded to take most of my cash out of the tray. Upon mentioning it, they just said it wasn't possible... I saw it happen myself.  A situation of thievery due to having incompetent employees unsuitable for their jobs!  The airport shows it has free WiFi, you'll have to register with your phone number for access to the Free WiFi, the code however will never arrive, so don't bother...  In the future I will definitely be avoiding this airport!",25 reviews,a month ago,5

It was extremely hot and humid with Air Conditioning not working. The whole luggage claim area has only a couple of restrooms each for men and women. Immigration queues had quite an awful wait time. At departures, the passengers are forced to wait outside the airport premises on bare ground if they arrive a few hours earlier. WiFi is even worse!

Everything is a lot smoother, there are staff designated to helping visitors and staff in general are a lot friendlier it has become very efficient. There are a few issues that need pointing out one is that there needs to be better management of lines and the worst part and potentially dangerous part are the illegal unlicensed taxi drivers. You would be ambushed by them offering you low prices to take you to Makkah, beware of these guys I’ve heard of horror stories, people being left stranded with their possessions taken. I myself was naive enough to get in one and the driver kept stopping in the middle of the highway and demanding for more money or threatened to kick us out the car.
